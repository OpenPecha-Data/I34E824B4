The Melody of Youthful Joy

In Praise of Sarasvatī

by Longchen Rabjam

Homage to the goddess of poetry!

Goddess whose nature is supreme joy,You dwell on an isle in a sea of qualities.Mother of all
the victors and their heirs,Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

Goddess born afresh from snowmeltUpon the mountain of compassionTo create a gentle stream of
poetry,Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

As beautiful as the moon on the fifteenth night,Sixteen years of age and with a smiling face,Adorned
with chains that tinkle and chime—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

Like a lotus flower on lotus and moon-disc seats,Like a snow mountain, gleaming and white,Like
the billowing clouds of autumn—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

Your face is white as the light of the moon,The seat beneath you is a full lunar disc,Behind
you is fashioned a moonlike halo—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

In your strength, your radiance and your complexion,You eclipse the elephant, moon and lake-born
lotus;Your beauty is wholly and forever like the sun—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.


If a snow-capped mountain had eyesOf lotuses it would resemble your face,And your body is akin
to a snowy peak—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

Again and again, I recall your form.I focus on the vowels "A" and "Ā",And dispel darkness with
"Hrīṃ! Hrīṃ!"Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

Ema! Graceful heroine and yoginī,Today, you’re like a rainbow in the sky,Or like a reflection,
apparent and not—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

Within the mass of light that is your formRays of white, yellow, red and green lightSwirl about,
fusing and remaining distinct—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

To some, you appear in a cloud canopy,In form white, bright red and blue,Pre-eminent,[1] supreme
and peaceful—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

To some, you appear in sunlight, upon lotus and moon,Resplendent amidst a mass of five-coloured
light,With a fly-whisk and playing vīṇā and flute—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

To some, you appear illuminated and among the stars,Issuing emanations from one moment to the
nextAnd demonstrating miracles, visible and invisible—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

To some, you appear in a pavilion of light,Smiling beautifully amidst variegated rays,As you
emanate and send forth creations—Sarasvatī, I pay homage to you.

Ema! Goddess of excellent fortune,Long-standing aspirations are today fulfilled.When I wish
to see, hear or question you again,Pray, reveal your enlightened form!

Please direct the supremely white,Radiant moon of your perfect wisdomTowards all those who have
faithIn you and in your progeny.

Henceforth, throughout all my lives,Glorious goddess, be my guide,And bring me the great wisdomOf
an unobstructed intelligence.

As I am born as if into a grove of lotuses,With honey-like qualities of family and form,And
the hundred petals of acclaim,May you always sustain me with your care.

May you and all your heirsAlways guide and care for me.And may I always savourYour infinite
glory and renown.

May all who see, hear or reciteThis supreme melody of youthful joyBehold the very face of SarasvatīAnd
be guided and cared for by her.

Through the virtue of offering such praise,May all beings enjoy perfect intelligence,Attain
the supreme level of Sarasvatī,And become a source of universal benefit to beings.

From the fine lotus pool of ethical discipline,May the swan of intelligence call out,Spread
the broad white wings of threefold trainingAnd bring happiness to all beings with clear minds.


Based on prior learning, oceanic in extent,And the glorious goddess’s conferral of siddhi,I,
whose intelligence defies the imaginationAnd is a source of poetry, composed this.

May there be virtue, excellence and auspiciousnessUntil the three realms of existence come to
an end.

This praise to the noble lady of eloquence entitled The Melody of Youthful Joy was composed
by the well-versed poet Samyepa at the Spontaneously Created Jewel-Source Mountain.
